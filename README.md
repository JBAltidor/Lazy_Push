# Lazy_Push
Bash script to automatically pull/push a git repository

The script does the pull/pushing routine for you. For those who forget (or )
Just git it an interval, open a new terminal and let it work.

To Use :
- Copy 'LazyScript.sh' into your repository
- Add it to your .gitignore (open or create a .gitignore and write 'lazyScript.sh')
- run 'bash LazyScript.sh'
- Enter an interval period (how much minutes you want between updates)

To stop just Ctrl+C;
