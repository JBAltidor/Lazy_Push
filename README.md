# Lazy_Push
Bash script to automatically pull/push a git repository.

The script does the pull/pushing routine for you. For those who forget( Like me! ).
Just give it an interval and let it work.


To Use :
- Copy 'LazyScript.sh' into your repository.
- Add it to your .gitignore (open or create a .gitignore and write 'lazyScript.sh').
- run 'bash LazyScript.sh'.
- Enter an interval period (how much minutes you want between updates).
- Open a new terminal to get it out of your way.

To stop :
- Ctrl+C;

PS: A good commit message is alwas a good idea , so beware. You can also change the defaut "Lazy Push" message
